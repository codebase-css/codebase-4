# Codebase

The super tiny website frontend library.

_Version 4.0.1_

## Features

* Designed as a frontend CSS/JS codebase for content management system themes and static site generator projects
* Just use it in your HTML: no NPM or other installation required – no config – no need to purge unused CSS
* Small but powerful CSS:
  * Base (default light theme only): `codebase.css` (35 KB)
  * With dark and light theme CSS classes: `codebase-l-d.css` (54 KB)
* JS options:
  * Use Codebase’s own `activator.js` (3 KB) for dropdowns, modals, tabs etc.
  * Alternatively, use [AlpineJS](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine) for more component functionality
* Sass (SCSS) library
* Responsive layouts and typography
* Does most things most web designers want:
  * Columnar grid system (uses _CSS grid_)
  * Flexbox system
  * Utility classes for layout positioning, dimensions, overflows, etc.
  * Utility classes for decoration and enhanced typography, using a soft element grid (0.5rem units)
  * “Utility first” approach for building HTML components.
* Highly customizable
* Modern browser compatible
* Extensive documentation
