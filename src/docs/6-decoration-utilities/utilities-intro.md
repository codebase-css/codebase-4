<p class="t-lg t-thin">After the <a href="/docs/2-basics/basics-intro">basic (classless) styles</a> and the <a href="/docs/3-layout/layout-intro">layout styles</a>, Codebase has a lot of <em>utilitiy classes</em> from which you can make up most components of your website or webapp’s user interface.</p>

Utility classes are CSS classes that each do one thing (e.g. set some padding, or set a background color), applying the style directly on the HTML tag to which is assigned.

(There are also a number of _component classes_ where something more than a decorative utility class was required.)

Codebase has utility classes for:

* [Layout](/docs/4-utilities/layout) – display, position, float, etc.
* [Spacing](/docs/4-utilities/spacing) – i.e. margins and paddings, based upon the Codebase [0.5rem element grid](/docs/4-utilities/element-grid).
* [Borders](/docs/4-utilities/borders) – a few simple styles, plus rounded corners/
* [Box shadows](/docs/4-utilities/box-shadows) – to give the appearance of layering up block elements.
* [Color](/docs/4-utilities/color) – for details, buttons, labels, badges, etc.
* [Text](/docs/4-utilities/text) – a range of typographic alternatives.
* [Images](/docs/4-utilities/images) – a few things you can do to images using CSS.
* [Invisibility](/docs/4-utilities/invisibility) – for when you want to hide things for smaller and larger divices.

Codebase basics, components and utility classes are built upon a [0.5rem element grid](/docs/4-utilities/element-grid).
