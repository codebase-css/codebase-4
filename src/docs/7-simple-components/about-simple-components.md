<p class="t-lg t-thin">Codebase has several simple component examples, that are mostly assembled from utility classes.</p>

(I’m calling a Codebase component _simple_ if it doesn’t require  JavaScript for functionality.)

There are two occasions when Codebase uses bespoke component CSS classes:

1. Where it makes more sense to apply a CSS cascade that affects nested HTML elements.
2. For complex Codebase components that require some added features (e.g. for CSS transitions) for visualising their change of state.

Simple Codebase components:
